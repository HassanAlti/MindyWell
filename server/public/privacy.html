   * white space refers to any spaces, tabs, or newline characters that are used to format the CSS code
   * specifies how white space within an element should be handled. It is similar to the "pre" value, which tells the browser to treat all white space as significant and to preserve it exactly as it appears in the source code.
   * The pre-wrap value allows the browser to wrap long lines of text onto multiple lines if necessary.
   * The default value for the white-space property in CSS is "normal". This tells the browser to collapse multiple white space characters into a single space, and to wrap text onto multiple lines as needed to fit within its container.

<p id="26783121-e2a9-4841-9ef9-f54e61ee8047" class="">This Cookie Policy explains how MindyWell, Inc. (“MindyWell, “we”, or “us”) uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our Services as defined in our Privacy Policy. Here, we explain what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
<h3 id="d566c358-b7c8-4099-823a-8cac3eeed48a" class="">
<strong>1. What are cookies and similar technologies?</strong>
</h3>
<p id="204eb0ce-b767-49d2-9c84-f82c693c08ac" class="">
<strong>Cookies.</strong>
A cookie is a text file containing a string of characters that is sent to your device when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. Cookies set by the website owner are called “first party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through a website (e.g., interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
</p>
<p id="317106e1-00d7-4bb3-b480-b1546cb9b5c0" class="">
<strong>Local storage.</strong>
Local storage technologies refer to the methods that websites and applications use to store data locally on your device. The most commonly used local storage technology is called “local Storage” and is part of the HTML5 standard. This technology allows websites or applications to store data that persists even after the user closes their browser or application, or restarts their device.
</p>
<p id="82261ba2-b0c6-4ca0-9827-f6b19004571b" class="">
<strong>Session storage.</strong>
Session storage is a feature of your web browser or device that allows a website or application to temporarily store data on your device while you are actively using the website or application. This data is deleted as soon as you close your browser or application, or navigate away from the website. Websites and applications may use session storage to improve your experience and ensure that certain information is readily available during your browsing session.
</p>
<p id="1e49d641-0626-440b-8259-d93d44f584bf" class="">
<strong>Other tracking technologies.</strong>
Websites and apps use a variety of other tracking technologies too, including web beacons (also known as tracking pixels), third-party tracking scripts, and analytics tools. These technologies provide data on how visitors use websites. We may also use web beacons and “clear GIFs” in communications with you to allow us to count how many people read them and to verify any clicks through to links within an email. If you do not wish for the web beacon to be downloaded onto your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.
</p>
<p id="b06af31e-59e9-4991-8927-eabae56c582c" class="">This Cookie Policy refers to all these technologies collectively as “cookies.”</p>
<h3 id="e2a76c76-326b-45f0-a9ed-91a1eb39a78b" class="">
<strong>2. What type of information do cookies collect?</strong>
</h3>
<p id="4319bfa6-ae75-4c45-a266-82f5857a2834" class="">We and our service providers may automatically log and combine information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, online resources and our communications, such as:</p>
<ul id="f742e09b-abe4-4779-a4af-9608c70c48a3" class="bulleted-list">
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Device data such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers, language settings and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="7c6e713d-5f71-42fd-9c86-bed7d557e64a" class="bulleted-list">
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Online activity data such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Services, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, duration of access and whether you have opened or otherwise engage with our communications.</li>
</ul>
<p id="98d1d05e-2077-423d-a648-05adc4bd0a72" class="">We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser.</p>
<h3 id="4e7fd85a-8d2b-4b39-871e-d30dbb79133c" class="">
<strong>3. Why do we use cookies?</strong>
</h3>
<p id="04c36b59-c28c-4839-8187-732be3adccae" class="">
<strong>We only use essential cookies.</strong>
These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with our Services, by, for example, providing page navigation and access to secure areas of the Services.

<strong>4. How can you control cookies?</strong>
</h3>
<p id="7328402c-9847-44af-894e-833b5d94c6df" class="">
